A dashboard UI built for The Odin Project Intermediate HTML/CSS curriculum.

## What I Learned

- CSS Grid for page-level and component-level layout control.
- Building multi-section interfaces with nested grids.
- Structuring HTML into reusable sections (`sidebar`, `header`, `content`, cards).
- Styling UI components consistently (buttons, cards, icons, avatar blocks).
- Combining spacing systems (`padding`, `gap`, `minmax`, `repeat`) to improve alignment.
- Creating visual hierarchy with typography (`font-size`, `font-weight`) and color contrast.
- Using border radius, shadows, and accent borders to improve card readability.
- Working with image assets and icon styling for cohesive UI presentation.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid based layout)

## Reflection

This project improved my confidence with CSS Grid and helped me understand how to break a complex UI into smaller, maintainable layout blocks.
